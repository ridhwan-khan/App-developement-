# first_app

This is my first app building on 1st year of my university life learning how flutter works and how to use dart code.
Understanding the code snippets and this is a pretty basic screen rending app it takes user input and outputs the result of the user based answer. 
it has a reset button to reset the application and start the app which helps to avoid the error supposed to occur after the index is out of range.
